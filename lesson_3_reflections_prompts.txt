1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

i) If more than 2 people are working on a project and they are located remotely, then in that case remote repository becomes handy.
ii) Lets say only 1 guy is working on a project. Keeping a remote repository will help him work from anywhere he like without having to take his computer everywhere.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

i) Only I know what changes are logical. So, manual pulling is sufficient.
ii) Automatic pulls might result in a version of our code which dont even compile.

use one instead of another?
